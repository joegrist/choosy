# Choosy

This only (most likely) app to use when you are stuck choosing a wine.

This is progressive web app.  Build it, and host the `dist` folder (renamed as `choosy`) on a web site, so it comes up as `https://mysite/choosy`. Users can then use the page, and us their OS tools to save it on a mobile device. It will work like an app, and they will never again be stuck for which wine to choose.  What a wonderful world it will be.
